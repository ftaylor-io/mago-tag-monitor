# Cursor Rules for MAGO TAG Monitor

## Agent Instructions

When you make changes to this repository, you MUST:

1. **Always commit your changes** after making edits
2. **Use the non-interactive commit script** to commit:
   ```bash
   COMMIT_MSG="Description of changes" ./scripts/commit-auto.sh
   ```
   Or alternatively:
   ```bash
   AUTO_COMMIT=1 AUTO_PUSH=1 COMMIT_MSG="Description" ./scripts/commit.sh
   ```

3. **Never leave uncommitted changes** - always commit before finishing a task

4. **Use descriptive commit messages** that explain what was changed

5. **Automatically push to GitHub** after committing (the scripts handle this)

## File Edit Permissions

- You have full permission to edit all files in this repository
- No approval is required for file edits
- Make changes directly when requested

## Git Workflow

- Stage all changes automatically
- Commit with descriptive messages
- Push to origin/main automatically
- Use the provided scripts - they handle everything non-interactively

## Important Notes

- The `scripts/commit-auto.sh` script is designed for agents and runs completely non-interactively
- If git is not configured, use: `AUTO_SETUP=1 GIT_USER_NAME="Agent" GIT_USER_EMAIL="agent@example.com" ./scripts/setup-git.sh`
- Never skip committing changes - this is critical for the workflow
